A personal project on Covid Analysis conducted in 2020, using data from the WHO to track worldwide cases and deaths from Covid-19
During the first wave as we saw cases differing across the world many studies were being conducted to find relationships with 
populations and cases. 
I conducted this analysis in late 2020, when a fair amount of raw data was being gathered and good analysis and visualisations 
could be produced. 
It was difficult to speculate to the causes of the different trends seen as wider implicating data was less readily available. 

I have used the Python Numpy and Pandas libraries to clean and aggregate data, and Plotly, plotly express and matplotlib to 
produce visualisations of that data. 

Since late 2020, the data available has increased both in volume and variety and this small study can be extended to include
different factors that may have affected death rates, as well as looking at the differences in the second wave in countries
that faired better during the first wave.
